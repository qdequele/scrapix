# Testing Scrapix

Scrapix includes a comprehensive test suite that can be executed using the command `npm run tests`. The primary objective of this suite is to validate the functionality of crawlers and scrapers. All configuration files for testing scrapers are located in the `misc/tests` directory.

## Prerequisites

Before running the test suite, ensure that you have a Meilisearch instance running on `http://localhost:7700`.

## Running Tests

To run the entire test suite:

```bash
npm run tests
```

To run the tests for a specific crawler or scraper, use the `-p` flag followed by the name of the crawler or scraper configuration file. For example:

```bash
npm run tests -p "*puppeteer.json"
```
